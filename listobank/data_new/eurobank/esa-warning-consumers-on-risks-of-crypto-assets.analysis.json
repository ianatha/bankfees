    "   \n \nESA 2022 15  \nESMA • 201 -203 rue de Bercy • CS 80910 • 75589 Paris Cedex 12 • France • Tel. +33 (0) 1 58 36 43 21 • www.esma.europa.eu  \n \nEU financial r egulators warn consumers on the risks of crypto -assets  \n \nThe European Supervisory  Authorit ies (EBA, ESMA and EIOPA – the ESAs) warn consumers \nthat many crypto -assets are highly risky  and speculative . These  are not suited for most retail \nconsumers  as an investment or as a means of payment  or exchange .  \nConsumers  face the very real possibility of losing  all their invested money if they buy  these \nassets . Consumers  should be alert  to the risks of misleading advertisements, including via \nsocial media  and influencers . Consumers  should be particularly wary  of promised fast or high \nreturns , especially those that look too good to be true .  \nConsumers should be aware of the lack of recourse or protection available to them , as crypto -\nassets and related products and services typically fall outside existing protection under current \nEU financial services rules .  \nTHINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW  AND CHECK  \n \nYou should be aware of the specific risks of crypto -assets and related products and services  \nand carefully weigh up whether the risks are acceptable given your own preferences and \nfinancial situation . These include  the risk that: \n \n• you may lose all the money you invest;  \n• prices can fall and rise quickly over short periods;  \n• you may fall victim to scams, fraud , operational errors  or cyber attacks;  and \n• you are unlikely to have any rights to protection or compensation if things go wrong.  \n \nIf you are thinking about buying crypto -assets or related products and services, you should \nask yourself the following:  \n \n• can you afford to lose  all the money you invest ? \n• are you ready to take on high risks to earn the advertised returns?  \n• do you understand the features of the crypto -asset or related products and services?  \n• are the firms /parties  you are dealing with reputable?  \n• are the firms/parties you are dealing with blacklisted by the relevant national \nauthorities ?1 \n• are you able to protect  effec tively  the devices you use for buying, storing or \ntransferring crypto -assets , including your  private  keys? \n \nWhat are the  key risks?  \n \n1 Please note that not being blacklisted is no guarantee that a firm/party is safe to engage with  ",
    "    \n2 \n \n \n• Extreme price movements:  many  crypto -assets are subject to sudden and extreme \nprice movements and are speculative, because their price  often relies solely on \nconsumer demand  (i.e., there may be no backing assets or other tangible value ). You \nmay lose a large amount or even all of the money invested. The extreme price \nmovemen ts also mean that many crypto -assets are unsuitable as a store o f value, and \nas a means of exchange  or payment ; \n• Misleading information:  some crypto -assets and related products are aggressively \nadvertised to the public, using marketing material and  other information  that may be \nunclear, incomplete, inaccurate or even purposefully misleading. For instance, \nadvertisements via social media may be very short, with a focus on the potential gains \nbut n ot the high risks involved. You should also beware of social media ‘influencers’ \nwho typically have a financial incentive to market certain crypto -assets and related \nproducts and services and therefore may be biased in the communications they issue;  \n• Absenc e of protection: the majority of crypto -assets and the selling of products or \nservices in relation to crypto -assets  are unregulated in the EU.2 In these cases you will  \nnot benefit from the  rights and protections available to consumers for  regulated \nfinancial services, such as  complaints or re course  mechanisms;  \n• Product complexity:  some products providing exposure to crypto -assets are  very \ncomplex , sometimes with features that  can increase the magnitude of losses in case \nof adverse price mo vements . These  products, given their complexity, are not suitable  \nfor many consumers ;  \n• Fraud and malicious  activities : numerous fake crypto -assets and scams  exist and \nyou should be aware that their  sole purpose is to  deprive you of your money  using \ndifferent techniques, for example phishing ; \n• Market manipulation , lack of price transparency  and low liquidity : how crypto -\nassets prices are determined and the execution of transactions at exchanges is often \nnot transparent . The holding  of certain cr ypto-assets is also highly concentrated , which \nmay impact prices  or liquidity . You  may therefore not get a fair price or treatment when \nbuying or selling crypto -asset s, or not be able to sell your crypto -assets as quickly as \nyou would want in the absence of a potential buyer . Cases of m arket manipulation have \nbeen reported on multiple occasions ; and \n• Hacks , operational risks  and security issues : the distributed ledger technology \nunderpinning crypto -assets can bear specific risks. S everal issuers and service \nproviders for crypto -assets, including crypto exchanges and wallet providers, have \nexperienced cyber -attacks  and severe operational problems. Many consu mers have \nlost their crypto -assets or suffered losses due to such hacks and disrupti ons or because \nthey have lost the private keys providing access to their assets . \n \n \n2 Some Member States in the EU have implemented national rules to regulate certain crypto -assets and related products or \nservices. In addition, providers of so me types of crypto -asset services, including exchange services and custody services are \nrequired to be authorised or registered for the pu rposes of anti -money laundering and counter -terrorist financing. Please refer to \nthe relevant competent authority for further details.  ",
    "    \n3 \n \nBackground information  \n \nThis Warning is based on Article 9(3) of the founding Regulations of the ESAs.3 It follows earlier  \nwarnings about the risks of buying/holding crypto -assets.  4,5, 6 \n \nCrypto -assets can be defined as a digital representation of value or rights which may be \ntransferred and stored electronically, using distributed ledger technology or similar technology.  \n \nThe ESAs note growing consumer activity and interest in  crypto -assets , including so -called \nvirtual currencies  and the emergence of new types of crypto -assets  and related products and \nservices , for instance so-called non -fungible tokens (NFTs) , derivatives with crypto -assets as \nunderlying , unit -linked life insurance policies with crypto assets as underlying  and \ndecentralised finance (DeF i) applications, that claim to generate high and/or fast returns. The \nESAs  are concerned that an increa sing number of consumers  are buying those assets with \nthe expectation that they will earn a good return  without realising the high risks involved . \n \nIn September 2020, the European Commission presented a  legislative proposal  for a \nregulation on markets in c rypto -assets.7 The proposal provides  a comprehensive framework \nfor the regulation and supervision of issuers and providers of services for crypto -assets with a \nview to protect consumers and the integrity and stability of the financial system . Consumers \nare however  reminded that the proposal remains subject to the outcome of the co -\nlegislative  process .8 Consumers will not currently benefit from any of the safeguards foreseen \nin that proposal until it is adopted and applies . \n \nAs at the date of this warning, t here are more than 17,000 different crypto -assets , some  of \nthem being sometimes referred to as so-called ‘virtual currencies’ or digital ‘coins’ or ‘tokens’ .9 \nThe most prominent crypto -assets to -date include bitcoin and ether, which together represent \nabout 60% of the total market capitalisation of crypto -assets.  The energy consumption of some \ncrypto -assets is high , e.g., from mining and validation processes , and consumers should be \naware of the ir environmental impact.10  \n \n3 Regulation (EU) 2019/2175 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2019 amending Regulation (EU) \n1093/2010 establishing a European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority), OJ L 331, 15.12.2010, p. 12 : \nRegulation (EU) 1094/2010 establishing a European Supervisory Authority (European Insurance and Occupational Pensions \nAuthority), OJ L 331, 15.12.2010, p. 48 ; Regulation (EU) 1095/2010 establishing a European Supervisory Authority ( European \nSecurities and  Markets Authority) , OJ L 331, 15.12.2010, p. 84 . \n4 EBA (2013), Warnin g to consumers on virtual currencies , 12 December  \n5 ESAs (2018), ESAs warn consumers of risks in buying virtual currencies , 12 February  \n6 ESMA (2021), ESMA sees high risks for investors in non -regulated crypto -assets , 17 March.  \n7 Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on Markets in Crypto -assets, and amending Directive \n(EU) 2019/1937 , COM/2 020/593, 24/09/2020.  \n8 The ordinary legislative procedure - Consilium (europa.eu)  \n9 Source: Coinmarketcap.com , data as of 3 March  2022  \n10 For futher details, see for example Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (2022), ‘ Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity \nConsumption Index’  "
